This lab is an introduction to how optimization and control theory can be implemented in physical systems. The problems are solved using the computer software MATLAB and Simulink, and are tested in a safe environment in which a fixed electrical flying object is manipulated to fly on a  calculated trajectory. A given set of states are controlled with and without feedback and constraints.\\

We want to thank the student assistants for giving us guidance through this exercise and leading us to a feasible result.
