\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The optimal trajectory for the helicopter is achieved by using some of the built-in functions in MATLAB to minimize the objective function. The results from these calculations were satisfying, and with the introduction of feedback and LQR the helicopter did not drift away from the desired position. Additional constraints may be added to give the helicopter a more accurate performance. All in all, the performance of the implemented tools and calculations are shown by several tests to yield a satisfying result.
