\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

Simulating the calculated optimal solution without feedback as discussed in section~\ref{sec:10.2} provided a result corresponding with the calculated optimal solution, but without feedback the helicopter drifted away from the desired position. By introducing feedback and LQR in section~\ref{sec:10.3}, the helicopter was able to more precisely follow the optimized solution. By tuning the weights in the LQR matrices, the helicopter could be forced to follow the trajectory more accurate. With the introduction of elevation and nonlinear constraints, the cost of calculating an optimal trajectory increased, but yielded a solution that looked more natural. It is clear that for the helicopter to follow an optimal trajectory and have a satisfying performance, feedback and a controller is necessary.
